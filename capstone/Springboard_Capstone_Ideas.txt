Springboard Capstone Ideas
1. Predicting and identifying malfunctioning Personal Weather Stations (PWS). Wunderground is a weather forecasting site that uses 250,000+ PWSs to provide weather information. Sometimes the PWSs do not report accurate data. The idea is to identify and alert when a PWS is not functioning as expected. Data would be gathered from the Wunderground website and possibly through their API.
2. Daycare / Pre-School quality and performance by area within Colorado. Availability and quality of daycare and preschools for children, especially infants vary considerably based on location. The idea is to consider what factors into this. Data would be gathered from Colorado state resources and department of health websites.
3. Predicting gentrification of sections within the Denver metro area. Gentrification is widespread within Denver, possibly due to a quickly increasing population and a lack of housing. This is changing once diverse and established communities. The idea is to look at what circumstances are contributing to gentrification and predict if communities are likely to be gentrified. The data sources used would be a combination of State housing data and Zillow / Redfin website data.
